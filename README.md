# AI-Powered Travel Planner

## Problem Statement
Planning a trip manually is time-consuming and confusing due to budget constraints, lack of local knowledge, and difficulty in organizing places within limited time. Travelers often struggle to decide which places to visit, how to manage costs, and how to plan day-wise itineraries.

## Solution
This project proposes an AI-powered travel planner that generates personalized, budget-aware, and time-optimized travel itineraries. Based on user inputs such as city, travel days, budget, and interest type, the system intelligently recommends tourist places and organizes them into a day-wise travel plan.
